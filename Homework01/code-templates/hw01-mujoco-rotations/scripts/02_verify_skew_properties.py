02_verify_skew_properties.py -- HW1 Part 2, Task 2: verify the
skew-symmetric identities from Problem 5 in simulation.

STARTER CODE. Model loading and a simple "spin the body" simulation
loop are provided and working. Your job is to fill in the TODOs to:

  1. Log R(t), the body's rotation matrix, at several simulated
     time steps while it spins.
  2. At each logged time step, numerically check, for several
     random v, w, omega in R^3:
         R (v x w) == (R v) x (R w)                 [Problem 5a]
         R w^ R^T  == (R w)^                         [Problem 5b, No-AI on paper]
     using utils.hat() for the ^ operator.
  3. Print the residual (it should be ~1e-14, machine precision)
     and explain in your write-up why a small-but-nonzero residual
     doesn't fully validate the identity, while a residual near
     machine epsilon strongly supports it.

Note: you already proved these identities by hand in Problem 5.
This script is not a substitute for that proof -- it's a numerical
sanity check, and a chance to see *why* proofs and simulation are
complementary, not interchangeable.
