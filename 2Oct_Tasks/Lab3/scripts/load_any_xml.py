# This script loads a MuJoCo robot model from an MJCF (or URDF-converted XML) file 
# and launches the built-in MuJoCo viewer to visualize the model in its initial state.
# If you observe the robot falling in simulation it's natural since this code is specifically build to just load the robot.

# ❗ Ensure that the XML path is correctly specified before running.
